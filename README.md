## GraphicsProject 2016

**Due: January 3rd 2016**

You have just started working for a games company called GaCo, and as your first task you have been asked to create a small addictive 2D game using HTML5 and JavaScript.
The game will, for the time being, be focused only on players accessing the game through their desktop browser.
GaCo hopes the game will become popular, so that they can then sell advertisements on the webpage where the game is available.

### About the game:

This is by no means a fully finished game, I intend to continue to add features to it, such as:
- Blocks crumbling upon impact and cascading to the floor.
- Varying difficulties.
- Mouse tracking.
- Angle of rebound varying depending on the movement of the paddle during impact.
- Collision detection on the top surface of the paddle.
But the game is fully working as it is, extra feature will be added when I have the experiance and knowledge on how to do so.
With retro games such as these, there is only so much inovation that can go into them, at the end of the day pong is pong and tetris is tetris. 
Any code that may seem similar to any other code is not intended, as all the code was typed out and not copied. 

### How to play:

1. The program is a one player game, with the aim of getting rid of all the blocks using the ball.

1. The program lets the user move their paddle with the left and right arrows on the keyboard.

1. A score for the user is recorded on the left hand side.

1. The game is won when the user clears the screen. At which point the game is restarted.

1. The game is lost when the ball is not caught by the users paddle. At which point the game is restarted.


I hope you enjoy!
